# nvwatch
Small script to monitor NVIDIA GPU status.

This script polls GPU status continuously once per second and shows
the GPU, memory and power usage, temperature and fan speed. The script
can be terminated with CTRL+C, which exits the program and displays the
peak values of each monitored item.
